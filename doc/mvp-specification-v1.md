### YATMAN - Yet Another Tasks Manager :)

###### A simple tasks manager based on around projects.

The user must create a project where they can create their tasks.

A task must have a mandatory title and an optional description, sub-tasks can also be added.
A project must have a title, and may contain a description.

If the user wants to group projects, they can create a group.
A group must have a title, and may contain a description.

Groups can only be created on the main screen.
Projects can be created on the main screen and on a group screen.
Tasks can only be created within a project.

Then:
  - Groups are collections of projects.
  - Projects are collections of tasks.
  - Tasks are activities to be completed.
